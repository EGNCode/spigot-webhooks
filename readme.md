# Spigot Webhooks Plugin

So, I needed to collect some stats about our servers, events and players for a separate portal we're working on.
I ran through a variety of options including [AMP](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) and parsing the server logs.

I was unable to find any plugin that was relatively up to date that would provide me with the data I needed. 
I've resorted to writing this myself, as I do also need more Java practice.
Any and all feedback is welcome. It will be a growing project, and by no means follows best practices.
